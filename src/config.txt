// id is used to tell the server who sent which message. just needs a name that lets the host recognise it is you
// host is the ip address or hostname of the host
// port is an optional field and takes the value 3001 by default. note the other fields are mandatory however
// players is an optional field that is used to calculate how many targets a command should hit (eg targetHalf with players=3 will target 2 people)
//     note if the players field is defined here, this value takes precedence over the value defined inside the client.js script itself
//     useful when running the client as an exe instead of via node
